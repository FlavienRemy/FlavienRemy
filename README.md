## Hi there 👋  
I'm **Flavien**, a 34-year-old passionate developer, always on the lookout for new technologies and eager to explore innovative solutions.

## Where am I?

📍 **Didenheim**, France (near Mulhouse)  
💻 Fully Remote since 2020  

## About Me

💼 **Fullstack Developer over 4 years of experience with a focus on SaaS and e-commerce solutions** <br/>
I’ve spent the last few years working on a variety of **SaaS platforms** and **e-commerce tools**, especially in the logistics and second-hand sectors. My expertise lies in integrating **payment service providers** (like **Stripe**, **Adyen**, and **PayPal**), developing scalable **API-driven backend solutions**, and building systems that power efficient warehouse management. From stock management to order preparation, I thrive on solving complex challenges with clean, maintainable code while ensuring seamless integration through **RESTful APIs**.

💻 **Tech-Savvy and Versatile**  
My work spans both backend and frontend technologies. I enjoy architecting systems with **Node.js**, and **Symfony**, but I also appreciate the dynamism of **ReactJS** and **TypeScript** for frontend development. Whether I’m optimizing an API or building out an e-commerce flow, I always focus on delivering a smooth user experience.

👷 **Independent, yet Collaborative**  
In previous roles, I worked in **small squads** of 5 developers where I was responsible for the backend, but today, I manage projects on my own. I collaborate with freelancers, distributing tasks, providing guidance, and ensuring that all features are built to the highest standards.

🌐 **Language Skills**  
I’m more comfortable working in French, but I can handle English for reading documentation and participating in calls. While I understand most conversations, I sometimes struggle with speaking fluently, especially with grammar and conjugation. However, I'm continually working on improving this aspect to better contribute in international projects.
